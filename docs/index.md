# AI First Documentation

Welcome to **first.ai** — an open, living guide for building websites that are readable and understandable by AI systems.

## About

The way people discover information online is changing.
More and more users now ask AI assistants — such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot — instead of searching and clicking through traditional websites.

This shift means that, just as we once optimized for search engines (SEO),
we now need to design content that AI systems can understand, index, and cite.

AI-first web design focuses on semantic clarity, structured data, and factual precision —
so that your website isn’t just visible in a browser, but also readable and quotable by AI assistants

>In the AI era, visibility comes not from being seen — but from being understood.

## Why This Matters

The majority of user queries are shifting from search engines to AI assistants.  
Visual design is becoming secondary — **content quality and structure** are becoming the new priority.

If you want your content to be visible, cited, and understood by AI, it needs to be:
- technically accessible,
- semantically clear,
- and ethically open.
