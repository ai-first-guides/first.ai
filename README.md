# first.ai

A living guide to building AI-first websites — HTML for the AI era.

---

## Vision
AI First provides practical rules and examples for building AI-readable websites.
It focuses on metadata, semantics, and minimalism to make HTML more transparent to AI models.
Through open discussion and shared patterns, the project bridges the gap between traditional SEO and the coming AI-based web discovery.

### Why It Matters

The number of queries made to AI systems such as ChatGPT is growing rapidly — at the expense of traditional web search.
Visual design and marketing slogans are becoming less relevant.
What truly matters now is content that AI can understand, structure, and cite as a trusted source.
AI First helps creators focus on building websites that communicate meaning, not decoration.
