# first.ai

A living guide to building AI-first websites — HTML for the AI era.

---

## Vision
AI-first web design is based on a simple observation: **more and more queries go directly to AI assistants** instead of traditional search engines.
If you want AI systems to understand, trust, and cite your content, the web must be written for them — not only for the visual browser.
Just like SEO once made websites visible to Google, **AI-first structure increases the chance that your website becomes the source AI systems quote**.
As browsing shifts from humans to assistants, AI-SEO — semantic, structured, machine-legible content — becomes essential.

AI First provides practical rules for building content that AI can reliably interpret:
 - AI-readable structure (clear HTML hierarchy, minimal JavaScript)
 - Metadata and JSON-LD that models can actually consume
 - Meaningful, factual content instead of decorative fluff
 - Design that works for both humans and AI
